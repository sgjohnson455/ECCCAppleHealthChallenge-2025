Pear is a prototype for a gym membership sharing app designed to address this challenge. Pear allows users to create an account to track gym progress, and has a feature to match with buddies in an area. Pear relies on gym memberships allowing guest passes under one membership, so that eligible buddies can share the cost of a single membership and both attend.

Pear comes with four main tabs:
- the Dashboard - users can access their membership cards and see personal stats
- the Buddy Tab - users can match with a buddy, and then view details about their buddy
- the Notebook - users can log details about their workouts and other health stats
- the Community Feed - users can make and see posts from members about their community

Additionally, Pear has two modes: Casual and Competitive.
In Competitive mode, users are also able to see their buddies stats, as well as community stats.
